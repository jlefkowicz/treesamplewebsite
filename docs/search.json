The leaves grow perpendicular (at a right angle) from the twig in pairs, also known as growing in opposite orientation.Tthe leaves will grow in sets of two with one leave always across from another on every twig. Mature leaves will average between 3 and 5 inches, and are equally as wide. Leaves are yellow-green on top and lighter on the underside, and turn yellow, orange or red in autumn.\n\nThe bark of Sugar maples is brown and furrowed (having deep rifts or valleys between bark plates). The bark of the tree changes with age, with younger trees having grayish-brown bark and mature trees having bark that is a dark brown. The bark has vertical grooves that are closely spaced. They edges of the bark plates will gradually lift as the tree gets older, and the plates will flake away from top to bottom once the tree has reached full maturity.\n\nBark of a young Sugar maple:\n\nBark of a mature Sugar maple:\n\n\nThe twigs of a Sugar maple are small and thin, growing out of larger branches and colored a reddish-brown. The small buds at the end of each twig should be colored in tiny brown-colored scales. The buds are useful in distinguishing Sugar maples from Norway maples, a close look-alike, as the buds of the Norway maple are larger and covers in purple scales which form a rounded tip.\n\nThe fruits of a Sugar maple are green, and turn brown in fall. Each fruit has two leaves growing from opposite sides of the fruit, forming a “wing shape” (called a samara), these wings aid in the wind dispersal of the seeds within the fruit. The wings connect at the fruit and are oriented 60 to 90 degrees from each other and the total samara structure should measure about 1 inch in length."

However, the looming threat of climate change presents emerging risks, as cold winters are required for proper seed germination.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n\nBlack pine, also known as Austrian pine or European black pine, is a conifer native from central Europe to western Asia. As a medium to large tree, the black pine tyipcally grows to a height of 40 to 60 feet tall. Young trees have a distinct pyramidal shape, while the crown of older trees rounds out with age. Although the tree is not native to North America, it has naturalized in the northern states and has been widely planted in New England, around the Great Lakes and in the Northwest."

The edges are slightly serrated and can be straight or curved\n\n\n\n\nThe seed cones grow to 5-8 cm and are symmetrical. They are green when young and ripen to light brown with thick, smooth scales which end in a small, flat or blunt tip. Cones are usually singly or in pairs on short stalks, attached close to branches. The cones usually persist in the canopy through winter after the seeds have dropped.\n\n\n\nThe bark on young black pines is dark gray, rough and furrowed. As the tree ages it breaks into semi-rectangular, scaly plates and turns dark gray to blackish in color.\nMature black pine bark:\n\n\n\nYoung black pine bark:"

    "section": "Ecological Services",
    "text": "Ecological Services\n\nAside from basic services such as carbon sequestration and airborn pollutant interception, black pines offer numerous other benefits, which partially explain their widespread use as a landscaping tree. The trees have extensive root networks, as well as high adaptability and soil tolerance. These root systmes help stabilize slopes, quarries and degraded soils. These trees have particularly been used to rehabilitate strip-mined lands, and other sites of that nature, due to their adaptability and resistance to high concentrations of heavy metals in the area. Additionally, the trees are used widely as street trees as they are resistant to salt spray (used for road de-icing)."

These labels will be plaques with the species’ name, as well as a QR code which when scanned will bring up an infographic with information about the tree. The goal for the trail at The Grove is to have it serve as a template for a community-wide tree walk, which would encompass areas like Highland Park."
