    "text": "Summary\n\nThe white oak is a large, deciduous tree native to eastern and central North America. Known for their rounded canopy, deeply lobed leaves, and light gray bark, white oaks can grow up to 100 feet tall and live for centuries. White oak produces high-grade wood that is strong and rot-resistant, making it ideal for woodworking."

    "text": "Identifying Features\n\nLeaves are alternate and made up of 7-10 rounded lobes. They are typically 4-7 inches in length. The upper surface is bright green and smooth, with the underside being whitened and smooth. Fall colors can range from brown to red.\n\nBark is light gray to almost white in color and has a flaky-like appearance. 2 different types of bark patterns on the lower trunk can be seen:\n\nBlocky bark pattern:\n\n\n\nFlaky bark pattern with long plates, resembling shingles\n\nThis pattern is always seen in the upper canopy trunk and limbs\nFlaky bark pattern:\n\n\n\nAcorns produced by these trees are about 1 inch long. They are oval to oblong with the “cap” of the acorn covering almost 1/4 of the total acorn. They start as light green and turn brown when they mature. They mature in one growing season and germinate following their dispersal in the fall.\n\nThe leaves of the white oak look similar to to post oak, bur oak or overcup oak. What makes the white oak leaves distinguishable are their deep finger-like rounded lobes\nWhite oak bark looks similar to the barks of multiple other oak species, including swamp white oak, swamp chestnut oak, and overcup oak."

    "text": "Ecological Services\n\nWhite Oaks provide food for many animals, including blue jays, black bears, and more, through their acorns. White oaks are also a common habitat for over 500 species of moths and butterflies. Due to their large size, they are also able to sequester a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases. White Oaks also have the ability to filter water through their roots, providing clean habitats for freshwater aquatic animals"

    "text": "Conservation\n\nWhile there are many mature white oaks across the eastern United States, there are relatively few seedlings and saplings growing. This is indicative of the overall regeneration of white oaks being on the decline. Factors contributing to this decline include:\n\nfire suppression\noverabundant deer populations\nland-use changes, invasive species\nclimate change\ncompetition from other species like the red maple, whose growth and expansion has been favored by recent conditions\n\n\n\nUltimately, the conservation of the white oak can be optimized through a multi-faceted approach of prescribed burns, protecting saplings, and limiting the influence of deer.\n\n\nReferences\nRogers, R.

These labels will be plaques with the species’ name, as well as a QR code which when scanned will bring up an infographic with information about the tree. The goal for the trail at The Grove is to have it serve as a template for a community-wide tree walk, which would encompass areas like Highland Park."

Through this information, we hope to foster greater appreciation for the benefit of trees and their ecosystem services, as well as combat Nature-deficit disorder, which is a disorder referring to the negative impacts resulting from people spending less time in nature. Ultimately, we hope to inspire future environmentalists and allow people to meaningfully engage with their surrounding natural environment.\n:::"
