    "text": "Ecological Services\n\nWhite Oaks provide food for many animals, including blue jays, black bears, and more, through their acorns. White oaks are also a common habitat for over 500 species of moths and butterflies. Due to their large size, they are also able to sequester a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases. White Oaks also have the ability to filter water through their roots, providing clean habitats for freshwater aquatic animals"
