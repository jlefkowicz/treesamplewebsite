Eastern redbud is a flowering tree, meaning flowers bloom before leaves appear. In the spring, light pink and purple flowers bloom and attract many pollinators. The native range of eastern redbud spans from the eastern United States to norther Mexico."

High deer populations lead to heavy browsing, which apply pressure on the trees and suppress growth. Additionally, the lack of fire regimes which previously exists and worked to reduce competitors has taken away some of the “evolutionary edge” the tree has over other species. Active management is reccommended to ensure successful regeneration of this species.\n\n\nReferences\nSmithsonian Gardens. (n.d.). Object: Collections Explorer ofeo-SG_2011-0705A.

The leaves grow perpendicular (at a right angle) from the twig in pairs, also known as growing in opposite orientation.Tthe leaves will grow in sets of two with one leave always across from another on every twig. Mature leaves will average between 3 and 5 inches, and are equally as wide. Leaves are yellow-green on top and lighter on the underside, and turn yellow, orange or red in autumn.\n\nThe bark of Sugar maples is brown and furrowed (having deep rifts or valleys between bark plates). The bark of the tree changes with age, with younger trees having grayish-brown bark and mature trees having bark that is a dark brown. The bark has vertical grooves that are closely spaced. They edges of the bark plates will gradually lift as the tree gets older, and the plates will flake away from top to bottom once the tree has reached full maturity.\n\nBark of a young Sugar maple:\n\nBark of a mature Sugar maple:\n\n\nThe twigs of a Sugar maple are small and thin, growing out of larger branches and colored a reddish-brown. The small buds at the end of each twig should be colored in tiny brown-colored scales. The buds are useful in distinguishing Sugar maples from Norway maples, a close look-alike, as the buds of the Norway maple are larger and covers in purple scales which form a rounded tip.\n\nThe fruits of a Sugar maple are green, and turn brown in fall. Each fruit has two leaves growing from opposite sides of the fruit, forming a “wing shape” (called a samara), these wings aid in the wind dispersal of the seeds within the fruit. The wings connect at the fruit and are oriented 60 to 90 degrees from each other and the total samara structure should measure about 1 inch in length."
