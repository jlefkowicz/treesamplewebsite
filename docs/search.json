Known for their rounded canopy, deeply lobed leaves, and light gray bark, white oaks can grow up to 100 feet tall and live for centuries. White oak produces high-grade wood that is strong and rot-resistant, making it ideal for woodworking."

They are oval to oblong with the “cap” of the acorn covering almost 1/4 of the total acorn. They start as light green and turn brown when they mature. They mature in one growing season and germinate following their dispersal in the fall.\n\nThe leaves of the white oak look similar to to post oak, bur oak or overcup oak.

    "text": "Conservation\n\nWhile there are many mature white oaks across the eastern United States, there are relatively few seedlings and saplings growing. This is indicative of the overall regeneration of white oaks being on the decline. Factors contributing to this decline include:\n\nFire suppression\nOverabundant deer populations\nLand-use changes, invasive species\nClimate change\nCompetition from other species like the red maple, whose growth and expansion has been favored by recent conditions\n\n\n\nUltimately, the conservation of the white oak can be optimized through a multi-faceted approach of prescribed burns, protecting saplings, and limiting the influence of deer.\n\n\nReferences\nRogers, R.

    "text": "Summary\n\nThe Sugar maple is a large deciduous tree that is native to eastern North America. Typically reaching 60-75 feet in height, the Sugar maple has a dense, rounded crown and five-lobed leaves which transform into brilliant colors during the autumn. Younger trees have a smooth and gray bark which becomes rough with age. Due to its high Sugar content, the sap is used to produce maple syrup."

    "text": "Identifying Features\n\nThe leaves of Sugar maples are segmented into 5 lobes characterized by sharp points and connected by smooth, U-shaped notches However, some younger individuals might have fewer than 5 lobes. The leaves grow perpendicular (at a right angle) from the twig in pairs, also known as growing in opposite orientation.Tthe leaves will grow in sets of two with one leave always across from another on every twig. Mature leaves will average between 3 and 5 inches, and are equally as wide. Leaves are yellow-green on top and lighter on the underside, and turn yellow, orange or red in autumn.\n\nThe bark of Sugar maples is brown and furrowed (having deep rifts or valleys between bark plates). The bark of the tree changes with age, with younger trees having grayish-brown bark and mature trees having bark that is a dark brown. The bark has vertical grooves that are closely spaced. They edges of the bark plates will gradually lift as the tree gets older, and the plates will flake away from top to bottom once the tree has reached full maturity.\n\nBark of a young Sugar maple:\n\nBark of a mature Sugar maple:\n\n\nThe twigs of a Sugar maple are small and thin, growing out of larger branches and colored a reddish-brown. The small buds at the end of each twig should be colored in tiny brown-colored scales. The buds are useful in distinguishing Sugar maples from Norway maples, a close look-alike, as the buds of the Norway maple are larger and covers in purple scales which form a rounded tip.\n\nThe fruits of a Sugar maple are green, and turn brown in fall. Each fruit has two leaves growing from opposite sides of the fruit, forming a “wing shape” (called a samara), these wings aid in the wind dispersal of the seeds within the fruit. The wings connect at the fruit and are oriented 60 to 90 degrees from each other and the total samara structure should measure about 1 inch in length."
