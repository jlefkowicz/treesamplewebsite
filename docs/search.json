Typically reaching 60-75 feet in height, the Sugar maple has a dense, rounded crown and five-lobed leaves which transform into brilliant colors during the autumn.

    "text": "Identifying Features\n\nThe leaves of Sugar maples are segmented into 5 lobes characterized by sharp points and connected by smooth, U-shaped notches However, some younger individuals might have fewer than 5 lobes. The leaves grow perpendicular (at a right angle) from the twig in pairs, also known as growing in opposite orientation.Tthe leaves will grow in sets of two with one leave always across from another on every twig. Mature leaves will average between 3 and 5 inches, and are equally as wide. Leaves are yellow-green on top and lighter on the underside, and turn yellow, orange or red in autumn.\n\nThe bark of Sugar maples is brown and furrowed (having deep rifts or valleys between bark plates). The bark of the tree changes with age, with younger trees having grayish-brown bark and mature trees having bark that is a dark brown. The bark has vertical grooves that are closely spaced. They edges of the bark plates will gradually lift as the tree gets older, and the plates will flake away from top to bottom once the tree has reached full maturity.\n\nBark of a young Sugar maple:\n\nBark of a mature Sugar maple:\n\n\nThe twigs of a Sugar maple are small and thin, growing out of larger branches and colored a reddish-brown. The small buds at the end of each twig should be colored in tiny brown-colored scales. The buds are useful in distinguishing Sugar maples from Norway maples, a close look-alike, as the buds of the Norway maple are larger and covers in purple scales which form a rounded tip.\n\nThe fruits of a Sugar maple are green, and turn brown in fall. Each fruit has two leaves growing from opposite sides of the fruit, forming a “wing shape” (called a samara), these wings aid in the wind dispersal of the seeds within the fruit. The wings connect at the fruit and are oriented 60 to 90 degrees from each other and the total samara structure should measure about 1 inch in length."

The genus name Cercis derives from the Greek kergis, meaning weaver’s shuttle. This refers to the shape of its bean pod, which resembles the shuttle that weaver’s use to move thread through a loom. Eastern redbud is a flowering tree, meaning flowers bloom before leaves appear. In the spring, light pink and purple flowers bloom and attract many pollinators. The native range of eastern redbud spans from the eastern United States to norther Mexico."

Young trees have a conical shape while a rounder crown develops with age. This tree sprouts at the base, resulting in a clump of trees growing around what was the original tree. The trees can be found throughout the Eastern U.S. on mesic sites, as well as areas with coarser sands. It is commonly found in deciduous woodlands close to wetter areas."

White ash does not do well in poorly-drained lowlands, in these areas green or black ash tends to dominate instead. White ash sapplings are tolerant of shade, which allows for seedlings to establish and grow quickly in the understory to outcompete other shade tolerant trees.

In some swamp regions white ash acts as an ecosystem engineer, as they thrive in tidal zones which can help create and sustain wetland habitats. The leaves and roots contribute to a healthy forest floor, and improve soil quality through nutrient cycling and water retention. The trees provide food and shelter for a wide range of animals. The leaves tend to leaf our later in spring than other species, allowing a more extended period of canopy openness and benefiting ground plants.\n\n\nAnimal Uses and Relationships\n\nThe samaras (winged seeds) are a food source utilized by a variety of different animals, including wood ducks, finches, cardinals and fox squirrels\nWhite-tailed deer browse on the leaves of white ash\nPorcupines and beavers will eat the bark of young white ash trees\nWhite ash functions as a host tree for various insects\nCavities form frequently in the truck of white ash, which are crucial for cavity-nesting birds such as pileated woodpeckers.\n\nThese cavities are then utilized by secondary nesters, such as gray squirrels and owls\n\nWhite ash has a mutualistic relationship with morel mushrooms, engaging in nutrient exchange with their fungal networks"

    "text": "Conservation\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) gives the white ash a Critically Endangered classification. This classifiaction is not refelctive of the current state of the species, rather the projection of the future state of white ash populations. There is a projected decline of over 80% over the next 3 generations of the species. The primary driver of ash decline is the emerald ash borer (EAB), a jewel beetle (bupresitd) native to Eastern Asia. In its native range, the EAB fucntions as a secondary pest, meaning it feeds on a tree already in poor health (stressed due to drought, disease, etc.). However in North America, the EAB acts as a primary pest (feeds on and kills healthy trees) as the native ash trees lack defense mecahnisms present in Asian ash populaitons. This invasive wood-boring insect has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America. The beetle will lay its eggs in the bark crevices of an ash tree, and when the eggs hatch the larvae will burrow into the tree and feed on the inner bark and phloem. This leads to a decline in the tree’s condition and eventually death for an infected tree. EAB threatens not only white ash, but the entire North American Fraxinus genus, which includes 7.5 billion trees. Signs of an infected tree are as follows:\n\nCanopy Thinning:\n\nEpicormic Sprouting (growth of new shoots from under a tree’s bark on the lower trunk, the tree’s “last-resort” to survive by growing new leaves closer to the roots):\n\nD-Shaped Exit Holes (resulting from adult beetles emerging from under the bark):\n\nS-Shaped Tunnels Made by Larvae:\n\nAdult Emerald Ash Borer Beetle:\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
