    "text": "Ecological Services\n\nWhite Oaks provide food for many animals, including blue jays, black bears, and more, through their acorns. White oaks are also a common habitat for over 500 species of moths and butterflies. Due to their large size, they are also able to sequester a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases. White Oaks also have the ability to filter water through their roots, providing clean habitats for freshwater aquatic animals"

These labels will be plaques with the species’ name, as well as a QR code which when scanned will bring up an infographic with information about the tree. The goal for the trail at The Grove is to have it serve as a template for a community-wide tree walk, which would encompass areas like Highland Park."

Through this information, we hope to foster greater appreciation for the benefit of trees and their ecosystem services, as well as combat Nature-deficit disorder, which is a disorder referring to the negative impacts resulting from people spending less time in nature. Ultimately, we hope to inspire future environmentalists and allow people to meaningfully engage with their surrounding natural environment.\n:::\n\n\nAbout us"
