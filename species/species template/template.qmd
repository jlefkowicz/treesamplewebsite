## Identifying Features

* Leaves are alternate and made up of 7-10 rounded lobes. They are typically 4-7 inches in length. The upper surface is bright green and smooth, with the underside being whitened and smooth. Fall colors can range from brown to red.

* Bark is light gray to almost white in color and has a flaky-like appearance. 2 different types of bark patterns on the lower trunk can be seen:
  * Blocky bark pattern
  * Flaky bark pattern with long plates, resembling shingles
    * This pattern is always seen in the upper canopy trunk and limbs


## Summary

#### The white oak is a large, deciduous tree native to eastern and central North America. Known for their rounded canopy, deeply lobed leaves, and light gray bark, white oaks can grow up to 100 feet tall and live for centuries. White oak produces high-grade wood that is strong and rot-resistant, making it ideal for woodworking.

## Ecological Services

#### White Oaks provide food for many animals, including blue jays, black bears, and more, through their acorns. White oaks are also a common habitat for over 500 species of moths and butterflies. Due to their large size, they are also able to sequester a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases. White Oaks also have the ability to filter water through their roots, providing clean habitats for freshwater aquatic animals

## Fun Facts
* White Oaks can grow to over 100 feet tall. 
* They prefer a more acidic soil to grow in. 
* White Oak is the state tree of Connecticut, Illinois, and Maryland. 
* White Oaks were used to create the USS Constitution, a large naval boat used        during the War of 1812.
* White Oaks are often used to create the wooden barrels used to store wine and       whiskey. 

## Indigenous History/Use
* acorns for food
* medicinal purposes, specifically an astringent, tonic, antiseptic, emetic, and supported healing from long intermittent fevers, indigestion, milky urine, and chronic dysentery
* bathed in bark tea for chills and fevers, as well as drank it for asthma relief, or applied it directly to a sore 
* decoction of inner bark used for lost voice
* used as a craft product as splits for baskets, lumber, firewood, furniture and other projects
* bowmaking
* leaves used to wrap dough for breadmaking

## Conservation

#### While there are many mature white oaks across the eastern United States, there are relatively few seedlings and saplings growing. This is indicative of the overall regeneration of white oaks being on the decline. Factors contributing to this decline include:
* fire suppression
* overabundant deer populations 
* land-use changes, invasive species
* climate change 
* competition from other species like the red maple, whose growth and expansion has been favored by recent conditions

#### Ultimately, the conservation of the white oak can be optimized through a multi-faceted approach of prescribed burns, protecting saplings, and limiting the influence of deer.
