## Summary

#### The Norway maple is a large, non-native deciduous tree that can grow up to 60 feet tall. Tolerant of many growing environments, the Norway maple has shallow roots and produces significant shade with its dense and rounded canopy. This makes it difficult for other plants to grow in the understory below. Its leaves are broad with five to seven lobes, often larger than the leaves of native maples.

## Identifying Features
