## Summary

#### Eastern redbud is a deciduous tree in the bean family. As a small, ornamental tree, it can often be found growing beneath larger trees. The genus name Cercis derives from the Greek kergis, meaning weaver’s shuttle. This refers to the shape of its bean pod, which resembles the shuttle that weaver’s use to move thread through a loom. Eastern redbud is a flowering tree, meaning flowers bloom before leaves appear. In the spring, light pink and purple flowers bloom and attract many pollinators. The native range of eastern redbud spans from the eastern United States to norther Mexico.
